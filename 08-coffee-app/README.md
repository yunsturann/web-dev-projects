## Coffee App

- I learned how to use AOS and SwiperJS.
- I practiced typescript, tailwind and responsive design.
- I made my reusable Button component with Typescript.
- I practiced making animations while coding this application. Design is not mine but codes are mine. Design is from <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">Efe Görkem Ümit</span>. Thanks to him for this design and I learned how to use swiper and aos libraries. You can reach his youtube channel from link below.
